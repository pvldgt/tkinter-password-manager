This is a password manager built in Python using the tkinter library.

The program is created as a study project based on
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/20948482 with some added functionality added on top of the basic 
instructions provided in the lesson.

The program lets you store your username/password pairs 
in a .txt document locally on your machine. 
The program can also generate a random highly secure password for you
if needed.
